Angular Notes
1) What is Angular?'
--Angular is javascript framework which allows you to create reactive Single-Page-Application(SPA). i.e page loads only once in it's life cycle and after that only some particular portion of page loads not complete page

2) Initial Command to start with angular
	--> npm install -g @angular/cli (to install angular CLI globally)
	--> ng new my-dream-app (To create new angular application)
	--> cd my-dream-app 
	--> ng serve (To start dev server)
	
3) What is typescript and what is Transpilation process
	--> Typescript is superset of javascript it offers more features then javascript like class,interfaces, types
	--> It is open source programming language developed by Microsoft
	--> Typescript doesn't run in browser it compiles to javascript at the end hence this process is called as Transpilation

4) What is component?
	--> Component are key feature of angular
	--> In angular App component is root component
	--> Component allow you to split complex application into small reusable parts
	--> One angular application has multiple component and each component having its own html,styling and business logic

5) What is decorator?
	--> Decorator are typescript feature which allow you enhance your classes
	--> Below are some example of decorator
	a)@Component (Use to create component)
	    @Component({
			selector: 'app-dashboard',
			templateUrl: './dashboard.component.html',
			styleUrls: ['./dashboard.component.css']
		})

6) What is module in angular? (Will go in deep dive later on)
	--> Module is bundle of functionality of application basically gives idea to angular which feature are used in this module
	
7) What are different way to write selector in angular
	1) By element (Normally used in application)
	2) By Class name selector
		a) In ts file write selector as
			@Component({
				selector: '.app-servers',
				templateUrl: './servers.component.html',
				styleUrls: ['./servers.component.css']
			})
		b) In HTML write selector as
			<div class="app-servers"></div>
	3) By attribute selector
		a) In ts file write selector as
			@Component({
				selector: '[app-servers]',
				templateUrl: './servers.component.html',
				styleUrls: ['./servers.component.css']
			})
	    b) In HTML write selector as
			<div app-servers></div>
	Note: we can not write selector as id
	
8) What is data binding?
	--> Data binding is nothing but communication between ts code(Business logic) and HTML
	a) Output data:
		--> String Interpolation ( {{data}} )
		--> Property Binding ( [property]="data")
	b) React to(User) event:
		--> Event binding ( (event)="expression" )
	c) Combination of both:
		--> Two way data binding ( [(ngModel)]="data" )
	
9) What is string interpolation?
	--> To disaply read only data on view template we can you string interpolation
	--> Write property name in {{ propertyName }}
	--> We can write method name which return string value as well in bracket
		e.g. {{ getStringValue() }}
		
10)What are the way to write template expression (template expression we are writing in {{ }} )
	a)we can right class variable in it
		e.g {{headername}} headername in class variable
	b)We can right mathematical expression
		e.g {{3+5}}
	c)We can call class function as well
		e.g {{getFullName()}} getFullName() in function which return string of full name.

11) What is property binding?
	--> Property binding is use to bind some HTML property dynamically
	--> To use property binding we enclosed HTNL element in square bracket []
		e.g. <img [src]="imgUrl"> imgUrl is class variable
		e.g <button class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="!allowUser">Add User</button>
		
12) Property binding Vs String Interpolation
	--> When we have to print simple text on UI dynamically then use string interpolation
	--> When we have to bind any HTNL property like disabled,src,innterText dynamically then use property binding
	
13) What is event binding and how to use it?
	--> Event binding is nothing but bind some HTML event to some method in ts file
	--> In event binding flow data from HTML to typescript file
	--> To use event binding we enclosed HTNL event in round bracket ()
		e.g <button (click)="onClick()">Click me</button>
